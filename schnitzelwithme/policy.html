                            which
                            it was collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing;
                            you
                            object to the
                            processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for
                            direct
                            marketing
                            purposes;
                            and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the
                            right
                            to erasure such
                            as
                            where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
                            information; for compliance
                            with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal claims.
                        </p>
                        <p>(vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Information that you have provided to us in
