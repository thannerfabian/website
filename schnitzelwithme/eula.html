                    <p>This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and Schnitzel

                    <p>Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the installation process and

                    <p>If you register for a free trial of the Schnitzel With Me software, this EULA agreement
                        will also govern that trial. By clicking "accept" or installing and/or using the
                        Schnitzel With Me software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and

                        to these terms and conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not agree
                        with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not install or use the
                        Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.</p>
